1. Fizz Buzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

2. Reverse a string: Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

3. Palindrome checker: Write a program that takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forward and backward), and false otherwise.

4. Calculate the factorial of a number: Write a program that takes an integer as input and returns the factorial of that number (i.e., the product of all the positive integers up to that number).

5. Fibonacci sequence: Write a program that prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, where n is an integer input.

6. Guess the number: Write a program that generates a random number and allows the user to guess the number. The program should give feedback to the user on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

7. Prime number checker: Write a program that takes an integer as input and returns true if the number is prime, and false otherwise.
