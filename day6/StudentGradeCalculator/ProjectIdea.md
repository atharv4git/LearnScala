Write a Scala program that can calculate the average grade of a class and provide various statistical measures such as the highest grade, lowest grade, and grade distribution.

__Your program should:__

- Define a `Student` class that includes a student name and grade.
- Use a `List` to store `Student` objects representing the students in the class.
- Implement a method that can calculate the average grade of the class.
- Implement a method that can find the highest and lowest grades in the class.
- Implement a method that can print out the grade distribution of the class.
