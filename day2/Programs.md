1. A program that calculates the average of a set of numbers.

2. A program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.

3. A program that finds the maximum and minimum value in an array.

4. Tower of hanoi: This is a mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one rod to another rod, with the constraint that you can only move one disk at a time, and you can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.

5. Binary Search: This is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

6. QuickSort: This is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array.

7. Merge Sort: This is another efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array.

8. Longest Common Subsequence: This is a well-known dynamic programming algorithm that finds the length of the longest subsequence common to two sequences.

9. Palindrome Checker: You can use recursion to check if a string is a palindrome or not by comparing the first and last characters of the string and then recursively checking the rest of the string.
